# Boggle App

A simple implementation of the [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) word game using Rails 6, React and Redux.

Code features:

- JS style enforced by ESlint
- Ruby style enforced by Rubocop
- Tests driven by RSpec
- YARD documentation

## Installation

Follow standard Rails deployment steps:

```sh
bundle
yarn

The app also requires a system word dictionary, so make sure to install at least one. For example, for American English, run:

```sh
apt-get install wamerican
```
